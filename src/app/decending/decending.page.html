      â€¢	Ascending triangles are considered a continuation pattern, as the price will typically break
       out of the triangle in the price direction prevailing 
      before the triangle, although this won't always occur. A breakout in any direction is noteworthy.

      The descending triangle is a chart pattern used in technical analysis. The pattern usually forms
       at the end of a downtrend but can also occur as a consolidation in an uptrend. A regular descending
        triangle pattern is commonly considered a bearish chart pattern with an established downtrend. 
        A descending triangle pattern, however, may be bullish, with a breakout in the opposite direction,
         known  as a reversal pattern.
